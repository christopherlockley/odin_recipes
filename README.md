# odin_recipes
Second course of Odin Recipes - As implied by the title, this is the second time I'll be completing the Odin Recipes project having stopped studying The Odin Project over twelve months ago. 
For this project, I will be creating a basic recipes website, initially with just the use of HTML. As a result, she may not be pretty! 
The project will demonstrate a thorough understanding of HTML, and I'll be writing the code from scratch with as little help from VS Code's autofill function as possible! 
If memory serves me well, the recipes website will later be stylised using CSS.
